  This module is used to interact with the global state
  needed to correctly generate version 1 and version 6 UUIDs.

  This state consists of two atomic values: the last timestamp at
  which a UUID was generated; and the current clock sequence value.

  On init, the clock sequence is seeded with a random value provided
  by interpreting bits from the cryptographic random number generator
  as an unsigned 14 bit integer.

  On subsequent generations, the clock sequence is incremented by 1
  if a UUID has already been generated with the same last timestamp.
  If the timestamp has changed, the clock sequence remains unchanged.
